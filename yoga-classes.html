Mat Collective was founded by existing members of Vancouver's already vibrant yoga community. The two co-founders, a passionate yogi/math nerd, and a city planner turned serial entrepreneur, saw a gap in the city's ability to deal with unwanted yoga mats and provide accessible yoga programs.</p>
<p>
Why free? Because we are truly captivated by our students. Many individuals have shared their stories with us when they come to our yoga classes. Whether it is because they are strapped for cash, going through a tough divorce, or can't afford physiotherapy and are living out of their car, we believe access to fitness classes need to be accessible to everyone no matter their income bracket. Also in the mix of yogis are long term residents and newcomers to the city or country. Everyone is welcome. We share individual stories, along with stories from our amazing volunteers on our social media accounts under #yogisofvancouver.
