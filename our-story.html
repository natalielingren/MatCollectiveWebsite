  <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>Mat Collective started out as a yoga mat recycling program, accepting unwanted yoga mats from across Greater Vancouver, BC. Our goal was, and still is, to turn yoga mats headed to the landfill into a resource for individuals and businesses looking to create a happier, healthier, city.</p>

<p>In 2017 we grew tenfold, and acquired not only a cozy studio space just off of Main Street & 32nd Ave, but also the largest free outdoor yoga program in Western Canada, formerly Kits Space. Located at Kits Beach, this outdoor yoga program is much more than just a great stretch; it is a community where friends are made, connections are rekindled, and a place you can unwind in the sunshine. We are now thrilled to now offer free outdoor yoga classes every day all summer long, as well as indoor classes at various institutions throughout the year.</p>

<p>Yoga mat recycling is still a big part of what we do. We accept yoga mat donations from studios, individuals and other businesses, and recycle them. Individuals can volunteer with us, and in exchange, get them selves a gently used yoga mat! We are also happy to provide short and long term yoga mat rentals from our studio.</p>

<p>Mat Collective was founded by existing members of Vancouver's already vibrant yoga community. The two co-founders, a passionate yogi/math nerd, and a city planner turned serial entrepreneur, saw a gap in the city's ability to deal with unwanted yoga mats and provide accessible yoga programs.</p>

<p>Why free? Because we are truly captivated by our students. Many individuals have shared their stories with us when they come to our yoga classes. Whether it is because they are strapped for cash, going through a tough divorce, or can't afford physiotherapy and are living out of their car, we believe access to fitness classes need to be accessible to everyone no matter their income bracket. Also in the mix of yogis are long term residents and newcomers to the city or country. Everyone is welcome. We share individual stories, along with stories from our amazing volunteers on our social media accounts under #yogisofvancouver.</p>
